# Hello, I'm Dustin!

I am a full-stack developer with a passion for building tools that help people create.

## My Journey

My passion for technology started at an early age, but I truly started to follow it after I built my first gaming PC in 2015. After this, I started learning more and more about computers of all types. In 2020, while I was working in the elctronics department of a retail store, I decided to take Google's IT Support Professional certification course. I learned about Linux, about Networking, Cybersecurity, System Administration, and it left me hungry to know more. 

At the time, I had never used any Apple devices, and I didn't have the money to buy a Mac, so for the purposes of learning I installed macOS on my gaming PC, creating a "Hackintosh" where macOS runs on non-Apple hardware. This lead me to realize that I really loved macOS and the Apple ecosystem, and on my Hackintosh, I learned to program. First in Python, and then in Swift as I learned to make iOS applications. I followed Paul Hudson's Hacking With Swift course, and build the projects in it, and grew to really love the Swift programming language. This was also how I really cemented in my mind the core foundations of programming and how to write code and structure projects. 

In this time, I've also been digging deeper into learning Linux and IT skills. I created a Home Lab where I utilized my Raspberry Pi and old HDDs from my Gaming PC to create a NAS for myself, got a mini PC where I can test self-hosted projects, and a Ubiquiti UDM-Pro which I use for advanced networking configurations to ensure that I keep my network secure and properly structured while I test these things. I also have experimented with using old PC parts for servers, which I use to host game servers for myself and my friends.

Later, I decided to try Game Development, as I've been a gamer for all of my life. I tried my hand at Unity for a while, and later moved on to Godot and fell in love with it. I have a passion project, inspired by the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. video game series from the Ukrainian developers GSC Game World. 

However, as fun as GameDev is for me, I find myself compelled to create real tools which will benefit people in various industries. I've began to study Backend development, starting with my first (programming) language, Python. 

Here is where I'm documenting my work, and showcasing my projects.
