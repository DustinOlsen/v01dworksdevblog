# Backend API

This folder is for your custom backend code.

Since you are learning backend development, you can build your API here using:
- Node.js (Express, Fastify, NestJS)
- Python (Django, FastAPI, Flask)
- Go (Gin, Echo)
- Rust (Actix, Axum)

The goal of this API could be to:
1. Serve the blog posts from the `content` directory.
2. Handle comments or contact forms.
3. Provide data for any dynamic features you add to your sites.
